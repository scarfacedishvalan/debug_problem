Input Context:

1. Problem Context:
{{PROBLEM_CONTEXT}}

2. Final Deterministic Evaluation Facts:
{{FINAL_EVALUATION_FACTS}}

3. Supporting Evidence (Semantic Signals and Scope):
{{EVALUATION_EVIDENCE}}

Task:
Write a thoughtful, high-quality subjective assessment of the candidate’s approach
to solving this problem.

You should treat the deterministic evaluation facts as authoritative and correct.
Do NOT re-evaluate correctness, completeness, or risk.

Your goal is to interpret HOW the candidate approached the problem in the context
of what the problem was intended to test.

Use the problem context to answer questions such as:
- Was the scope of the solution appropriate for this kind of problem?
- Does the solution reflect understanding of the underlying concepts being tested?
- Did the candidate show discipline in avoiding unnecessary redesign or overreach?
- Are the changes clear, maintainable, and robust given the stated objectives?
- Do the choices made suggest principled reasoning rather than trial-and-error fixes?

Guidelines:
- Focus on engineering judgment, not test outcomes
- Ground your assessment in the provided facts and evidence only
- Avoid speculation about missing features, alternative designs, or production scaling
- Do not introduce new requirements or reinterpret the problem
- Do not mention numeric confidence values, test counts, or internal scoring
- Avoid generic praise; be specific about what was done well or could be improved

Tone and style:
- Write as an experienced engineer giving internal interview feedback
- Be concise but insightful
- Prefer concrete observations over vague statements
- Balanced and professional, not overly positive or negative

Output requirements:
- Provide an overall assessment in 3–5 sentences
- Optionally list up to 3 concrete strengths
- Optionally list up to 3 concrete concerns
- If no meaningful concerns are evident, return an empty concerns array
- Do NOT repeat structured fields verbatim

Output must conform exactly to the following schema:

{{SUBJECTIVE_EVAL_SCHEMA}}
