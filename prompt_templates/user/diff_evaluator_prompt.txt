You are given:

1) A structured problem description defining expected behavior and known root causes.
2) A unified git diff representing the candidate's submission.

------------------------
Problem description (JSON):

{{PROBLEM_JSON}}

------------------------
Code change (unified diff):

{{DIFF_TEXT}}

------------------------
Evaluation criteria:

A. fixes_root_cause = true ONLY IF:
   - Every root cause listed in the problem description is fully fixed.
   - No fix is partial, incomplete, or masking the issue.
   - No new correctness issue is introduced by the change.

B. change_scope:
   - "minimal"   → Only lines strictly necessary to fix the root causes are changed.
   - "moderate"  → Some refactoring or cleanup beyond the fix, but still reasonable.
   - "excessive" → Large refactors, unrelated changes, or unnecessary redesign.

C. introduces_unrelated_changes = true IF:
   - Any change does not directly contribute to fixing the stated root causes.
   - Formatting-only or cosmetic changes count as unrelated unless explicitly required.

D. subjective_assessment:
   Brief summary covering:
   - Correctness and completeness
   - Code clarity and maintainability
   - Efficiency implications
   - Risks or edge cases

------------------------
Output schema (STRICT):

{
  "fixes_root_cause": boolean,
  "change_scope": "minimal" | "moderate" | "excessive",
  "introduces_unrelated_changes": boolean,
  "subjective_assessment": string
}
