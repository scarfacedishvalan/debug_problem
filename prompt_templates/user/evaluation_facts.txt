Input Format:
- TEST_SIGNALS: Structured test outcome signals
- DIFF_FACTS: Deterministic diff statistics
- DIFF_SIGNALS: Structured semantic diff signals
- VOCABULARY: Closed vocabulary of allowed reason codes, confidence drivers, and risk codes

Input:
{
  "test_signals": {{TEST_SIGNALS}},
  "diff_facts": {{DIFF_FACTS}},
  "diff_signals": {{DIFF_SIGNALS}},
  "vocabulary": {{VOCABULARY}}
}

Task:
Extract observable evaluation evidence according to this schema:

{{EVALUATION_FACTS_SCHEMA}}

IMPORTANT:
You are extracting EVIDENCE ONLY.
You are NOT making final decisions, classifications, or confidence judgments.

Your responsibility is limited to identifying what is directly observable in the input.

---

Global rules:
- Use ONLY the information provided in the input
- Use ONLY reason codes, confidence drivers, and risk codes present in the provided vocabulary
- Do NOT invent new codes or labels
- Do NOT infer developer intent
- Do NOT speculate beyond observable evidence
- Do NOT assume the existence of prior failures unless explicitly present in TEST_SIGNALS

Evidence extraction rules:
- Populate reason_codes ONLY when directly supported by DIFF_SIGNALS or TEST_SIGNALS
- Presence of passing tests MAY be reported as evidence via reason_codes or confidence_drivers
- Do NOT determine whether a change is a “fix”
- Do NOT determine whether a change is correct or complete
- Do NOT resolve or reconcile conflicting signals

Confidence driver rules:
- confidence_drivers describe observable factors that strengthen or weaken confidence
- confidence_drivers MUST NOT be numeric
- confidence_drivers MUST NOT imply correctness or completeness

Scope rules:
- Populate scope_assessment fields strictly from DIFF_FACTS
- Do NOT evaluate whether the scope is appropriate
- Do NOT infer intent from scope size

Risk rules:
- Include risk_codes ONLY when directly supported by DIFF_SIGNALS
- If no risks are observable, return an empty risk_codes array

Output constraints:
- Output MUST be valid JSON
- Output MUST conform exactly to the provided schema
- Output MUST NOT include commentary, explanations, or derived judgments
